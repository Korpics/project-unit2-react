N/A (in notebook will add here soon - my last mock up was really nice and this one was rushed so I'm stalling for a new one.)


#### Overview

Find a Job! 

The Api used is listed below vv

***https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/NYC-Jobs/kpav-sd4t***

The goal of this application will be to find jobs in NYC in a very simplistic manner. 

The filtering process used in this search application will provide a similar filter one can find on basic job searching apps.

The homepage will feature the ten most recent postings in a canvas with a scroll bar attached. 

There will also be a random job generator that generates a list of random jobs that fit the criteria you have specified (entry level, tech, entertainment, brooklyn ..etc). 

There will be many additions I would like to implement along the way, but I am more so focused on keeping this in scope and making sure I give myself an attainable goal before getting fancy. 

---

#### Tech 

- Will be using react route, and may utilize other libraries upon researching them/will add them to documentation if so. 


#### Tech Problems 

- I am firstly concerned over the algorithm for matching up selected jobs with the filter process.
I will be checking multiple open source projects to determine how others have done it and why before deciding on an approach.

- The random generator at it's default use will be easy - and does not worry me.  

#### BONUS

- I would like to find a way to post jobs as well. Will need to venture into the documentation for said API in order to figure out if this is possible and if so - will attempt implementation. 

- I would be very excited to try out some sort of local user database to use maybe in .env? I have mildly looked into this already and the process seems quite relative to the environment you're working in as well as the app you are making. I simply don't understand it enough to attempt this implementation but will look into it if the time is there. 

- Would like to add a feature that encourages you to aply for jobs that you would consider 'out of reach'. With that said, I would not like the function to provide them with irrelevant suggestions (i.e. user is filtering through jobs and internships. food service/entertainment. They are encouraged to apply for a paralegal position. That would be not good.). Will consider this implementation and I see this as the most likely bonus to make it's way into the app.
