'homepage'

***Link to Api
https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/311-Call-Center-Inquiry/tdd6-3ysr



                                Find out about all 311 calls in NYC
                            
                        
Homepage will consists of five clickable route components that will render the data correlated with said component.
 **LATESTt** renders last 311 call in table format.
 **RANDOM** renders a list of 10 random 311 calls in table format. 
 **TOPICS** brings you to a list of topics to choose from (violence, noise, transportation ..etc)
 **AGENCY** renders all 311 calls by selected agency. No input here - only mandated selection. 
 **ALL** renders the json object in it's entirety in table format. There will be a filterBy at the top if this page that will go by description of 311 calls. 



#### Example of JSON object from above API in table format.




                             **NEW CONCERN!!**

**
May need to use a second api as this api seems bound to specifically state sponsored jobs. I can work with this, but it was to my misunderstanding that these jobs would vary into broader categories. Will investigate alternative apis and will adjust my documentation accordingly. 
**



#### Tech 

- Will be using react route, and may utilize other libraries upon researching them/will add them to documentation if so.

- Will attempt to avoid any use of a server(node) when trying to implement Post. I am confident in my ability to program in react but I believe the 'Post' will prove to be challenging within react route. 


#### Tech Problems 

- I am firstly concerned over the algorithm for matching up selected jobs with the filter process.
I will be checking multiple open source projects to determine how others have done it and why before deciding on an approach.

- The random generator at it's default use will be easy - and does not worry me. 


            ****   NO LONGER A BONUS - WILL ATTEMPT IMPLEMENTATION ****
 ****              
I would like to find a way to post jobs as well. Will need to venture into the documentation for said API in order to figure out if this is possible and if so - will attempt implementation. 

I would be very excited to try out some sort of local user database to use maybe in .env? I have mildly looked into this already and the process seems quite relative to the environment you're working in as well as the app you are making. I simply don't understand it enough to maintain an exact method that I will use but I am confident that it is possible.

#### BONUS

- Would like to add a feature that encourages you to apply for jobs that you would consider 'out of reach'. With that said, I would not like the function to provide them with irrelevant suggestions (i.e. user is filtering through jobs with entry level requirements. transportation/sanitation. They are encouraged to apply for a paralegal position. That would be not good.). Will consider this implementation and I see this as more than likely to make it's way into the app with it's priority sitting behind my mandated function of 'post' and the accompanied 'user posted jobs section'.
