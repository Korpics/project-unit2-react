#### Overview



                                              ***Link to Api***

https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/311-Call-Center-Inquiry/tdd6-3ysr



                                        Find out about all 311 calls in NYC
                            
                        
Homepage will consists of five clickable route components that will render the data correlated with said component.

 **LATEST** renders last logged 311 call in table format.
 
 **RANDOM** renders a list of 10 random 311 calls in table format. 
 
 **TOPICS** brings you to a list of topics to choose from (violence, noise, transportation ..etc)
 
 **AGENCY** renders all 311 calls by selected agency. No input here - only mandated selection. 
 
 **ALL** renders the json object in it's entirety in table format. There will be a filterBy at the top of this page that will filter through calls via description of 311 calls. (matching sub string)



#### Example of JSON object from above API in table format.
